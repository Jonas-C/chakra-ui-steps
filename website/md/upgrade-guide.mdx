## Upgrade guide

If you are upgrading to v2 of this component you will need to make the
following changes: &nbsp;&nbsp;

- `StepsStyleConfig` has been renamed to `StepsTheme` - so you will need to update the reference to this in your theme config:

```diff
- import { StepsStyleConfig as Steps } from 'chakra-ui-steps';
+ import { StepsTheme as Steps } from 'chakra-ui-steps';
```

- Previously the `Steps` component accepted a `labelOrientation` prop, this has been removed in favor of the `circles-alt` variant. If you were using this prop you will need to update your code to use the variant instead:

```diff
- <Steps labelOrientation="vertical" />
+ <Steps variant="circles-alt" />
```
